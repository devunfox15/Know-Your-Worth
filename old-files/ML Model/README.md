## Machine Learning Model Folder

This contains the Juptyer Notebook used to import the data, clean it and train several models on the data. 
After running several files RandomForestClassifier had the best results so we decided to use it for our final model.
After training it was exported to a joblib file that is able to be plugged into python scripts
to help predict the salary of input data. There are comments in each section explaining how they work
and why they are imporant to the model.
